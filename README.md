#### 01. Intro

- Traditionally, React is used to make highly interactive pages (Heavy JS + Data Fetching)

#### 3. File-Based Routing

- For the routing, we add files named "page" for each folder (which will be the route)

#### Linking Between Pages

- Built in Link component:
  `<Link href="performance">Performance</Link>`

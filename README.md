## 01 - Intro

#### 01. Intro

- Traditionally, React is used to make highly interactive pages (Heavy JS + Data Fetching)
- Other sites don't require heavy interactoin or dynamic data fetching
  - Content driving sites
- One of the primary goals of Next is to expand the use of React to static sites

#### 02. Project Overview

- Landing Page
- Performence Page
- Reliability Page
- Scale Page

- Create Project:
  - npx create-next-app@latest
    - name
    - TS? y
    - ESLint? y
    - TW? y
    - src/? y
    - App Router? y
    - Change alias? n

#### File-Based Routing

- For the routing, we add files named "page" for each folder (which will be the route)
  - Each file must export by default a react component

#### Linking Between Pages

- Built in Link component:
  `<Link href="performance">Performance</Link>`

#### Common UI in Next JS with Layouts

- In the layout.tsx we can render a component that will render with all pages

#### Project Folder Structure

- We will keep in the app folder only the pages
  - The other files (compenents, util etc) will be structured in the src folder

#### Absolute Path Shortcut

- This '@' means the path from src (to avoid the messy '../../../')
  `import Header from "@/components/header";`

#### Images in Next JS - Image Component

- The Image Component adjust the size for the screen (Next server will resize the image before sending to the Client)
  - Work for local and online images
- We saved the image files in the public directory

e.g.: `<Image src={homeImage} alt="car factory" fill style={{ objectFit: "cover" }} />`

#### More about Image Sizing

- Layout shifting (when the iamge delays to load, so when it render, it changes the initial layout) is something we watn to always avoid
  - That's why we use the 'fill' prop
- When it's local image, it's automatic, when its from internet, we should manually insert height={} and width={}

#### Production Deployment with Vercel

- npx vercel

## 02 - Changing Data with Mutations (CRUD)

- This is a project for CRUD operations for code snippets (we want to create and show users some snippets)

#### Project Setup

- We are going to work with SQLite (local DB) and Prisma

- Setting Up Prisma

  - npm install prisma
  - npx prisma init --datasource-provider sqlite

- We need to tell Prisma the different kinds of data
  - Create the model in schema.prisma
  - npx prisma migrate dev

#### Creating a Prisma Client within Next.js

- Our project flow must be:

  - Create a Prisma client
  - Create a form
  - Define a Server Action (to be called when the form is submitted)
  - Validate Input and Create a new snippet
  - Redirect to Home Page (which shows all snippets)

- Create a db file creating the client (that allows us to interact with the db):

```javascript
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

export const db = new PrismaClient();
```

- An example of using Prisma would be:

```javascript
// Remember that snippet comes from our Model
db.snippet.create({
  data: { title: "Title", code: "const abc = () => {}" },
});
```

## 03 - Server Components

- Now we have created the form, we need to work in the server components

- Server actions

  - Number one way to change data (CRUD) in a next app
  - Server action are very integrated to HTML forms
  - Server actions are functions that will be called when a form is submitted

- Code:
  - "use server" is a next special string to define its a server action;
  - check formData type;
  - redirect was imported from 'next/navigation'

```javascript
const createSnippet = async (formData: FormData) => {
    // This needs to be a server action
    "use server";
    // Get input and validate
    const title = formData.get("title") as string; // As TS give is type FormDataEntryValue (which may be a string or a file)
    const code = formData.get("code") as string;

    // Create a new record in the database
    const snippet = await db.snippet.create({
      data: {
        title,
        code,
      },
    });
    console.log(snippet);

    // Redirect (to the Home Page for now)
    redirect("/");
  };
```
